jenkins-debian-glue (0.14.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  To reduce the amount of Debian binary packages we decided to
  minimize the number of packages we ship via jenkins-debian-glue.
  This means that the packages named
  jenkins-debian-glue-buildenv-git,
  jenkins-debian-glue-buildenv-svn,
  jenkins-debian-glue-buildenv-slave,
  jenkins-debian-glue-buildenv-lintian,
  jenkins-debian-glue-buildenv-taptools and
  jenkins-debian-glue-buildenv-piuparts are deprecated now.
  To get all the scripts just the jenkins-debian-glue package is
  needed. To install all the Debian packages that might be needed
  to be useful with all the scripts the
  jenkins-debian-glue-buildenv package can be used. If you don't
  want to install all the packages which are listed in
  jenkins-debian-glue-buildenv's Depends/Recommends you're
  encouraged to create your own metapackage or use the
  configuration management system of your choice.

jenkins-debian-glue (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The timestamp format used in automatically generated version
  strings changed.

  Until and including version 0.5.0 jenkins-debian-glue's
  generate-git-snapshot and generate-svn-snapshot scripts used
  "seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" inside the version
  string.  The new timestamp format YYYYMMDDhhmmss (in UTC) sorts
  equally well as unix timestamp and yet it is much more usable
  for human beings. As this timestamp change still increases the
  version numbers the change does NOT break any existing setups,
  but to avoid confusion it's worth noting.
